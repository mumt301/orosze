<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm a U3 Percussion Performance Student, as well as being part of the MAT minor at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.
<br>I am from Southern Ontario, primarily residing from Burlington, ON where I went to high school, however I have lived all over the GTA and Golden Horseshoe. 
<br>I like to spend my free time riding my bike, playing Tabla (south Indian hand drums), jamming along to some Rush on drums, and being outside in the wilderness on camping trips and hikes.</p>
