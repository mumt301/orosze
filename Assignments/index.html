<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I am a U3 Percussion Performance Student, and am also part of the MAT minor at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec.</p>
	<p>I am from Southern Ontario, primarily residing from Burlington, ON where I went to high school, however I have lived all over the GTA and Golden Horseshoe.</p>
	<p>Some of the things I like to do in my spare time include riding my bike, playing Tabla (south Indian hand drums), jam along to some Rush on drums, and being outside in the wilderness on camping trips and hikes.</p>
